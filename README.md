# Interactive 3D Solar System Exploration üåå

An immersive, interactive 3D visualization of our solar system built with Three.js. This web-based application allows users to explore the solar system, learn about different planets, and interact with celestial bodies in real-time.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive 3D Environment**: Fully navigable 3D space with realistic planetary orbits
- **Dynamic Star Background**: Multi-layered star field with varying brightness and subtle animation
- **Realistic Planet Visualization**: Accurate relative sizes and orbital distances
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Hover over planets to pause the system and view planet names
  - Click on planets for detailed information
  - Interactive sun with description
  - Orbit visualization with clear white paths
- **Responsive Controls**:
  - Orbital camera controls for free exploration
  - ESC key to close planet information
  - Click 'X' to close planet details
  - System pauses when examining planets

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: For 3D graphics rendering
- **WebGL**: For hardware-accelerated graphics
- **HTML5/CSS3**: For structure and styling
- **JavaScript**: For interactive functionality
